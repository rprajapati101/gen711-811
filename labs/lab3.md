7. You should see an 'open folder' on the left. Click it. The command prompt will have something like ```/home/unhAW/jtmiller/```. Click 'ok' open your home directory. If you saved a lab notebook to RON, you should see it on the left in a list of files. Click on it to open it. 
8. Next, we need to clone your gen711-811 github repo that you forked. Skip this step if you have done this already. If not, paste it into your lab notebook with <YOURGITHUBUSERNAME> replaced with your  username 
```
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/<YOURGITHUBUSERNAME>/gen711-811.git
```
9. Finally, we need to pull the latest updates to this repo. Run these commands:
```
cd gen711-811
git remote add upstream https://github.com/jthmiller/gen711-811.git
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master master
cd ~
```

#Raw Notes
Directory is just a folder
Pwd is a function that prints the directories. 
Ls lists all folder items, ls ‘ bumps into more, just remember to finish the quote (‘), hit control+c to exit out of that state, it exits the command.
	Ls has options, to specify do (-F) CASE SENSITIVEafter command: the -F forward slash shows that it is a repository
	Man ls (will give complete manual)(use google instead)
	Ls-lrth give information on the folder
Clear clears the directories
Tab complete key gets typing quick
Head  (put in file name) prints 10 lines
Cat prints the whole file. 
Cd ../ will take you back and if you add ../ its two steps out
Cd ~  will bring you back to the home directory
Rm -fR  will remove everything
Grep then do @to search in quotations, ^ searches the first line, put file name in the end
‘*’ Is a substitution unit
“ | “ this command pipes the output to a different command
Wc will count, -l count the lines -w counts the words, -c counts ths characters
